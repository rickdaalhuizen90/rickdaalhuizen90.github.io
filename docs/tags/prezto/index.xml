One of my favorite shells is fish shell. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to set-up and many of the features that I use comes pre-installed, as it is not POSIX supported it has a much readable (fish) syntax for scripting.
Why I switched from fish to zsh, and using Prezto over oh-my-zsh.</description></item></channel></rss>
